# Smart Flashcard System
This project helps you learn new words using flashcards.
You can add flashcards and review them later.


## How does it work?
You add flashcards with a term, definition, example (optional), and difficulty level.
Flashcards are saved on a backend server in a file called `data.json`.
You can see all flashcards on the main page.
You can delete single flashcards or clear all.
You can go to the review page to see flashcards one by one.
On the review page, you can show or hide definitions.

## Project files
`index.html`: Main page to add and see flashcards.
`review.html`: Page to review flashcards one by one.
`style.css`: Styles for both pages.
`app.js`: JavaScript for main page (add, delete, load flashcards).

## Backend details
